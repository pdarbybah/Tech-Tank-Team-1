+ Provide a prototype for a DevOps communication tool [a Slack bot known as ChatOps]
	+ Can currently retrieve the last commit in bitbucket
	+ Can search through recent commits for a person's commit
	+ Find the last opened active major issue (BitBucket)
	+ Announces when Hubot MegaTodd restarts

		+ JIRA for Spring, backlog, and issue management
		+ Confluence for wiki
		+ Bamboo for continuous integration testing and continuous deployment
